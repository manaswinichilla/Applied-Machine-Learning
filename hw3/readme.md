For Assignment 3 I was assigned Jiangqiong Li, 
We implemented both the parts seperately. Due to difference in results, we are pushing our own implementations separately. 
But I request you to please grade Jiangqiong Li's work for this assignment. 
Just in case, if her implementation lacks something, please kindly have a look at mine, 

Also, I am obligated to mention that for this assignment, for part 1 and part 2, I worked with my flatmate/classmate Adithi Mysore Mohan (admysore).
